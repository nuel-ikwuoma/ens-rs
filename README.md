# ENS-rs

### ENS-rs is the most up-to-date Rust library for ENS, built on [ethers-rs](https://www.gakonst.com/ethers-rs/getting-started/intro.html).  

## Please Note!
ENS-rs is built to keep parity with [ENSjs V3](https://github.com/ensdomains/ensjs-v3), which is the official javascript reference implementation 
by ensdomains.  

As a result of the stated reason above, please keep in mind that the project is still in its early stage and 
there might be breakng changes in the future.  

This library will be built and maintained as a public goods project, however it's open to contributions from the broader 
community.  

## Features
- Fast and lightweight
- Modular and easy to use
- Support for the latest and most up-to-date ENS feature set
- Built-in call batching for super fast RPC responses
